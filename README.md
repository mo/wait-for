# wait-for

wait-for is a Python script that runs a command every N seconds until the
command prints something new, prints a specific string or returns a given exit
code.

If you just need to wait until the command changes output, you can also use
```watch --chgexit cmd``` so this script is mostly mostly for when you need
to wait for a specific exit code / output.
